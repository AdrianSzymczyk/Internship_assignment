# Internship_task
An internship assignment

This task was made with Python in version 3.9 and I used Flask framework for the REST API. The operating system I used is Windows 10.
The tests I have done was by use the POSTMAN, free testing API platform.

Before you begin make sure you have installed Python version 3.9 or higher on your computer device.
To run the project first of all you have to run the command line and change directory to the folder where project's folder is saved. 
Then by using the command: <br>
**pip install -r requirements.txt <br>**
you have to install plugins required to proper operation. After that you have to simply run this command:<br>
**python run.py<br>**

The next step is to run the POSTMAN and import the collection of the requests *(REST_API.postman_collection)*. After this step you can test created endpoint and see the results.
